This is a case sensitive solution.\
The function - `checkAnagram` which can be found inside anagram.js file,\
can take more than two strings and check all permutations.

After cloning the project, run -

```
yarn
```

```
yarn test
```

Test cases are available inside `anagram.test.js`. You could add more tests here and then run -

`yarn test`

You need to have `yarn` installed in your system.\
Alternatively you could use `npm` too.
